# On call

## {background-image="background/slide1.jpg"}
Imagine you are a worker of on call system

## {background-image="background/slide2.jpg"}
And you are always attending all the calls because you are the most expertise worker.

## {background-image="background/slide3.jpg"}
But there is another workers, with less experience, that could attend some call, and let you deal with the most difficult ones.

## {background-image="background/slide4.jpg"}
You need a better algorithm to choose the correct operator.

## {background-image="background/slide5.jpg"}
Here is, where monorepo came to the rescue, and Bazel will build the solution.

## {background-image="background/slide6.jpg"}
Use a monorepo to build the code

## {background-image="background/slide7.jpg"}
Use Bazel to coordinate the different programing languages

## {background-image="background/slide8.jpg"}
Build the most accurate, performance and ... algorithm to solve the problem

## For the impacients
[Can wait?](https://github.com/josejuanmontiel/on-call-tutti/blob/develop/monorepo/projects/algorithms/README.md)

## For the very, very impacients

Use the data, implement the algorithm, test the result, beat another algorithm with new data, or even assure the correctness of the data, maybe the data are wrong, and the other algorithms fail.

## But if you reach here...

Imagine this set of data for on-call problem

![sample data](images/sample_data.png)

Do you think the input should produce this output in an algorith?
