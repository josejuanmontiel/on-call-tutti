## {background-image="background/slide3.jpg"}
But there is another workers, with less experience, that could attend some call, and let you deal with the most difficult ones.

## {background-image="background/slide4.jpg"}
You need a better algorithm to choose the correct operator.

## {background-image="background/slide5.jpg"}
Here is where this monorepo came to the rescue, and Bazel will build the solution.

## {background-image="background/slide6.jpg"}
Use a monorepo to build the code

## {background-image="background/slide7.jpg"}
Use bazel to coordinate the different programing languages

## {background-image="background/slide8.jpg"}
Build the most optimal algorithm to solve the problem
